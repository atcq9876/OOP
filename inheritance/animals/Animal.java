// INHERITANCE

// Inheritance refers to the ability of a subclass to inherit the properties and
// methods of its superclass. This allows for code reuse and can help to reduce
// redundancy in a program.
// Below is an example of this. In this example, the Animal class defines the
// basic properties and behaviors of all animals, which the Dog class inherits
// but also adds additional properties and behaviors specific to dogs.

class Animal {
    protected String species;

    public Animal(String species) {
        this.species = species;
    }

    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("The " + species + " is eating.");
    }

    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println("The " + species + " is sleeping.");
    }
}
