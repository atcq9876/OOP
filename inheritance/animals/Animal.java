// INHERITANCE

// Inheritance refers to the ability of a subclass to inherit the properties and
// methods of its superclass. This allows for code reuse and can help to reduce
// redundancy in a program.
// Below is an example of this

class Animal {
    protected String species;

        this.species = species;
    }

    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println("The " + species + " is sleeping.");
