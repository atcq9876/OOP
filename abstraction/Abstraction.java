// ABSTRACTION

// Abstraction in object-oriented programming is the process of simplifying
// complex systems by breaking them down into more manageable and understandable
// components. It allows programmers to focus on important aspects of a system,
// while hiding unnecessary details.
// - Programming example: if I am working in the frontend and I want to get
// information from a database, I just make a fetch request to that backend
// which retrieves and returns that information to me - I don't need to know how
// the API does this, just that it will return that information to me.

// In terms of an end user of a website, abstraction in object-oriented
// programming means that the user is only presented with the essential features
// and functionality of the website, while the implementation details are
// hidden from them. This makes it easier for the user to interact with the
// website without being overwhelmed by unnecessary information or
// functionality.
// - For example, imagine a website for a pizza delivery service. The user is
// presented with a simple interface that allows them to select the type of
// pizza they want, the toppings they want, and the delivery address. The user
// does not need to know the details of how the website is implemented, such as
// the database that stores the pizza orders, the algorithms that calculate the
// delivery time, or the APIs that connect to the payment system. All of these
// details are hidden from the user, and the user only needs to interact with
// the essential features of the website.
// - This abstraction also allows the website developers to change the
// implementation details of the website without affecting the user experience.
// For example, the developers may switch to a different database or payment
// system, or they may optimise the algorithms for calculating delivery time.
// These changes can be made without affecting the user interface, because the
// user does not need to know about the implementation details.
// - Overall, abstraction in object-oriented programming allows for a simpler,
// more intuitive user experience, while also allowing for greater flexibility
// and maintainability of the website's code.

// A real-life analogy for abstraction in programming could be a car dashboard.
// When driving a car, you do not need to know how the engine works or how the
// fuel is injected into the cylinders. All you need to know is the information
// displayed on the dashboard such as the speedometer, fuel gauge, temperature
// gauge, etc. The dashboard abstracts the complexities of the car's internal
// systems and presents only the essential information that is required for the
// driver to operate the vehicle.
